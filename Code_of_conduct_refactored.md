# Adimian Sprints Citizen Code of Conduct:
Welcome to Adimian Sprints, where we strive to bring together a diverse group of contributors! We're all about creating a friendly, safe, and inclusive space for everyone, no matter their background. To make sure everyone feels welcome and respected, we've created this Code of Conduct. Let's work together to create an amazing experience for everyone!

### 1. `Objective`
Adimian Sprints aims to welcome a diverse array of contributors by fostering an inclusive, friendly, and respectful environment for everyone, irrespective of their gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion. This code outlines expected behavior, consequences of unacceptable actions, and encourages participants to help create positive experiences.

### 2. `Open Citizenship`

### 3. `Desired Conduct`
Community members are expected to:

- Engage authentically and actively, contributing to the community's health and longevity.
- Be considerate and respectful in speech and actions.
- Seek collaboration before conflict.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and language.

### 6. `Consequences for Misconduct`
Misbehavior from anyone, including sponsors and decision-makers, is unacceptable. Offenders must cease such behavior upon request. Consequences for misconduct may include temporary bans or permanent expulsion without warning or refunds for paid events.
